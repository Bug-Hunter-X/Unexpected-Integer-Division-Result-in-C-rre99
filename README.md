# Unexpected Integer Division Result in C This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming related to integer division.  Integer division in C truncates the decimal part of the result, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered.  The `bug.c` file contains the code exhibiting this issue, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version. The issue is addressed by casting the operands to floating-point types before division to preserve the decimal part.
